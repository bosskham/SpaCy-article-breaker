Nothing had really happened yet, but he was already crying with emotion, thinking his life as a delivery boy was over. However, he then realized that his phone still showed a delivery to be made and was even displaying a map. He was confused because the delivery said to pick up a nectar. With nothing better to do, he decided to accept. As soon as he clicked, the golden gate in front of him opened. He swallowed hard, wondering where he was going, and he started riding above the clouds, passing by the castle. Looking at his phone, he was scared. That place was exactly where the map indicated, but it was something surreal. It was really where the gods lived. He entered a palace with giant pillars in front of a huge door. He wondered if this was where he was supposed to pick up the items. Hesitantly, he knocked on the door, knowing that if there might be a god there, he could have a chance to become a Hunter. Someone opened the door, asking who he was. Seeing the girl with blonde hair and a white cloak, he recognized her immediately as a goddess. Stumbling over his words, he said he was there to pick up the order. However, she came right up to him and asked why a human was there in Olympus. She said he invaded. But he pointed to his phone, saying he was there to pick up a bottle of nectar. She looked thoughtful and said it might be Hermes' doing. She sighed, telling him to wait while she fetched something humans shouldn't even touch. She handed him the bottle of nectar and warned him that if her brother didn't receive it on time, he would be very angry. She got in his face and said he better not take a sip of it, and he said he understood. She pointed to her eyes and said she was watching him, then slammed the door in his face once again.

He was angry. What kind of nonsense was this? He thought he would escape the life of a delivery boy, but now he had become a delivery boy who would also be scolded by the gods. Staring at the bottle, he said it looked like apple juice and thought about quitting the delivery. However, he reasoned that if it was her brother who would receive it, he must also be a god. And since he was here in Olympus, he might as well ask this other guy to maybe turn him into a mythical being. He put on his helmet, motivated, saying this was the last delivery he would ever make. With that, he started driving through the lava. A notification said he was approaching. After a mountain of magma, there was a small house. He arrived at the door, exhausted because it was hotter than a sauna there, and announced that the delivery had arrived. The door suddenly opened. The poor guy was dripping with sweat because it was scorching inside. In the background, there was the sight of a dwarf hammering on a forge, who turned around angrily and asked who entered. Embarrassed, Ha Jun said he wasn't an intruder; he was just there to make a delivery. The dwarf approached him, eyes gleaming, saying it seemed his sister sent this guy. The poor boy couldn't believe the two were siblings; they looked nothing alike. However, at this moment, the dwarf noticed he wasn't Hermes. Preparing his aura, he said the boy arrived there uninvited. Embarrassed, Ha Jun said it was his sister who asked him to deliver this thing. The dwarf realized the nectar bottle was full and told the boy it was amazing he brought it without taking a sip. Ha Jun said he wasn't that kind of thief; of course, he wouldn't drink someone else's stuff and handed it over, saying the dwarf could take it. The dwarf laughed, saying the boy was very honest. A sip of that nectar would have turned him into a god, yet he felt no temptation.
